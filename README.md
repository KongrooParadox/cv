# My LaTeX CV

First attempt at a CV using LaTeX.

This project is mostly an exercice in curiosity about **LaTeX** and an excuse to play with **nix** as a build tool.

## To Do

- [x] Working LaTeX document
- [x] Build using Nix (because why not make it reproducible ?)
- [x] Build with Github Actions
- [ ] Release with Github Actions
